<p>This page is part of the website that I have to make for my web programming class. In addition to projects for class
  I'm also posting projects that I've done on my own, though they may be works in progress.</p>
<p>Currently, there is very little here. As they're being worked on, projects will be added to the projects tab, 
  over there on the left, and will be classified based on whether they're personal ones I've done for fun, or ones done for 
  my class. I'll also include descriptions of them here, in the main body of the site.</p>
