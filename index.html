<h1>This is the index</h1>
<p>Currently, there isn't really much here. Later on, I may add a decidedly stereotypical text adventure, since I'm curious 
as to if it's possible to code an effective text adventure of the "choose your own adventure" variety, in HTML. It seems like it 
should be possible, and take little more than just links to pages setup  to correspond to your choices.</p>
<p>And of course, whatever stuff I'm required to place here for my CS class will show up. Since that's kind of the 
whole reason this is being created in the first place.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll even get to make the page look somewhat pretty, courtesy of the CSS we should be learning soon. It's
  the next thing in the textbook, so who knows, maybe it can start to look pretty, pretty soon.</p>
<h3>Personal Projects</h3>
<p>Here are a few projects I've done. None of them are directly related to the CS class that this page was made for, but
  they were made so that I could practice. They'll be listed below as they're completed.</p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="http://bunkch01.github.io/GMHQstart/GMHQstartpage.html">Generic medieval hero quest</a></li>
