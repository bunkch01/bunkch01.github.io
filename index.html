<h1>This is the index</h1>
<p>Currently, there isn't really much here. Later on, I may add a decidedly stereotypical text adventure, since I'm curious 
as to if it's possible to code an effective text adventure of the "choose your own adventure" variety. It seems like it 
should be possible, and take little more than just links to pages setup  to correspond to your choices.</p>
