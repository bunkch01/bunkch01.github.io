<p>This page is part of the website that I have to make for my web programming class. <strike>In addition to projects for class
  I'm also posting projects that I've done on my own, though they may be works in progress.</strike> Personal projects have 
  been removed</p>
<p>Currently, there is very little here. As they're being worked on, projects will be added to the projects tab, 
  over there on the left.</p>
