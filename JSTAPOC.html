Javascript Textual Analysis Proof of Concept
</header>
<project>
<h3>Tool Description</h3>
<p>
This is a proof of concept for a Javascript tool intended to for digital textual analysis. It currently has very limited
capabilities, since it's intended simply to test if what I am considering is possible. To use, simply click the labled button
in the primary field of this webpage
</p>
<p>
The text used for this proof of concept is sourced from Shakespeare's <i>As You Like It</i>, and specifically, from
 the FOlger Digital Editions version

<h4>input text follows<h4>
<p>
You know my father hath no child but I, nor
none is like to have; and truly, when he dies, thou
shalt be his heir, for what he hath taken away from
thy father perforce, I will render thee again in
affection. By mine honor I will, and when I break
that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet
Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise
sports. Let me seeâ€”what think you of falling in
love?
Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal; but
love no man in good earnest, nor no further in
sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou
mayst in honor come off again.
What shall be our sport, then?
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune
from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be
bestowed equally.
</p>
<h4>Output follows</h4>
<p>Number of times "man" appears in the text</p>
<button onclick="countingMenFunc();">Click this to update the counter</button>
<p id=mancounter>0</p>
</primary>
<script type="text/javascript">
counter = man;
countingMenFunc = function() {
counter = counter + 1;
manCount = document.querySelector('#mancounter');
mancount.innerHTML = counter;
}
</script>
</body>
