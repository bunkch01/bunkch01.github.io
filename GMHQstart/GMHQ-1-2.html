<p>You drop everything but your axe, which you raise over your head, as you charge towards the bandits. 
Your unintelligible screams sound enough like someone new dying in the blaze they set that the bandits don't really notice you
until too late, when their laughter stops and they turn around, just in time to see you bury your axe in the skull of one of 
the bandits. The other three swear loudly and draw swords. You aren't sure, but you think you hear something about stabbing 
you repeatedly. What do you do?</p>
<p><ul>
<li><a href="GMHQ-1-5.html">Leave the axe and run away, you don't like these odds</a></li>
<li><a href="GMHQ-dead.html">
Try to wrench the axe free, and continue to fight. You'll have your revenge dammit!</a></li>
<li><a href="GMHQ-dead.html">
Turn to face them. You can take them on with nothing but your fists!</a></li>
</ul></p>
