<h2>Welcome to Generic Medieval Hero Quest!</h2>
<p>Generic Medieval Hero Quest is a simple choose your own adventure game, coded entirely in HTML, just for me to have fun, 
and maybe even improve my coding skills. About the only interesting aspects of it are perhaps my strange sense of humor, 
and the self-mocking title.</p>
