<p>You carefully and slowly begin to walk after the bandits, sticking to the undergrowth on either side of the road. They don't 
seem to notice you, and you continue to follow them. After they walk for a while, the bandits eventually stop and make camp. 
They set up a fire, cook some food, and then go to sleep. However, they don't seem to have been smart enough to have anyone take
 watch</p>
 <p>It should be easy for you take advantage of this situation. What do you do?</p>
 <p><ul>
 <li>Sneak in and steal some of their food. You don't only want revenge, you want to eliminate the entire threat. Taking
  some food will make their life harder, but still let  you follow them, to find their leader. The bad guys always have a 
  leader</li>
  <li>Sneak up and slit their throats. They all deserve it. They deserve to die, and you shall be the instrument of Justice</li>
