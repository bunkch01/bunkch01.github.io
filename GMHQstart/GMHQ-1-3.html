<body>
<p>You slump to the ground, in a vaguely sitting position, and cry. You don't just cry, you scream in rage and anguish.
  All you wanted was a little adventure, not this. Your parents are dead, and the people who killed them are walking away.
  You don't want to end up like this, just sitting here, crying over your failures, crying over your guilt. Couldn't you
  have done something different?</p>
<p>Your screaming and crying seems to have attracted the attention of the bandits. You can see and hear them coming back your way
  , wondering who could have survived the fire they set. What do you do?</p>
<p><ul>
<li><a href="GMHQ-1-2.html"> take up your discarded axe, and charge the approaching bandits. You will make them suffer, or end 
your own suffering</a></li>
<li><a href="">Run away from the approaching bandits. You'll hide in the woods, and follow them later</a></li>
<li><a href"GMHQ-dead.html">Stay where you are. All that is left to you is sadness and suffering. The bandits
  wouldn't dare disturb your grief</a></li>
</ul></p>
