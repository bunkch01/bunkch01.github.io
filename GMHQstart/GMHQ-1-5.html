<p>You run away from the bandits, sprinting towards the woods that you had been in not that long ago, chopping firewood. You had
 always liked to retreat there to rest, to think. Well, to daydream really. That's what you did most of the time while you were
  there. Now you had to hide. They really looked like they wanted to kill you.</p>
<p>You climb into a well-foliated tree, hiding in the thick leaves. The bandits charge into the forest shortly after you reach 
your hiding spot, searching for you. There's mcuh swearing as they try to find you, looking through all the bushes and and ferns
 on the ground. Not one of them looks up</p>
<p><ul>
<li><a href="GMHQ-dead.html">Jump down on one of the bandits from above, and stab him through the neck</a></li>
</ul></p>
<p>You wait until the bandits leave the forest, rather than gamble with gravity. After spending another half hour searching for 
you, and describing all the horrible things they want to do before turning you into a mangled corpse, they eventually leave</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Stay the night in the forest, the bandits are way too dangerous to mess with</li>
<li><a href="GMHQ-1-4.html"> Climb down, and start to stealthily follow the bandits</a></li>
</ul></p>
